    "## Introduction\n",
    "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women globally. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment and recovery. The CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Image Dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains mammography images for detecting breast cancer. In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately classify mammography images as benign or malignant."

    "## Dataset\n",
    "The CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Image Dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains over 2,500 mammography images. The dataset includes images of both benign and malignant tumors. Each image in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding diagnosis."

    "In this project, we used the CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Image Dataset to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify mammography images as benign or malignant. Our model can be used as a tool to assist radiologists in detecting breast cancer early, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes."
